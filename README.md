# Ghost Town
## Overview
The project is a 2D Runner type game, developed by 2 students, based in Sofia, Bulgaria.

There will be 2 worlds, with one in the graphic forested with fairytale elements. In it, the player will have to jump over the obstacles that are directed against him. Each time he gets out of the obstacles, the player will receive points. **If the player dies from an obstacle, he goes to the other world only if he has the necessary points. If they are less the hero loses the game immediately.** 
The second world will be dark, there will be abandoned buildings and it will be more difficult than the first. There will also be obstacles in the second world, but the avoidance from them will be more challenging. **If the player receives the necessary points, he wins the game. If he is killed by an obstacle, he loses the game.**
