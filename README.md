# GhostTown

The game will be a 2D Runner type game. There will be 2 worlds, with one in the graphic forested with fairytale elements. In it, the player will have to jump over or kill the obstacles that are directed at him. Some can't kill them and I'll just jump over them, while others have to kill. Each time you get out of the obstacles, the hero will receive points. If a player dies from an obstacle, he goes to the other world only if he has the necessary points. If they are less the hero loses the game immediately. The second world will be dark, there will be abandoned buildings and it will be more difficult than the first. There will also be obstacles in the second world, but the rescue from them will be more challenging. If the player receives the necessary points, he wins the game. If he is killed by an obstacle, he loses the game.
